7/23/2015,80,fresh,Dan Jolin,Eden,"Partly the story of a music scene, but mostly the story of a man who realises that living the dream isn't always the best thing for your life. Vivid, immersive and blessed with a perfectly nostalgic soundtrack."
7/23/2015,80,fresh,Tim Robey,Eden,"Eden, in its loose and free-form way, is as personal a statement as this 34-year-old director has yet made: it's telling that Paul is that age by the end of it."

7/30/2015,20,rotten,Geoffrey Macnab,Stonewall,"The best that can be said is that director Anne Fletcher keeps the tempo very brisk, leaving as little time as possible for us to work out why we are not laughing."
7/30/2015,40,rotten,Ed Potton,Stonewall,"The makers of Hot Pursuit would love to add Reese Witherspoon and Sofia Vergara to that list of great odd couples in road movies. They won't, because the two entirely lack what those other duos had in abundance -- chemistry."

7/31/2015,40,fresh,Matthew Lickona,The Stanford Prison Experiment,"The film works hard to keep up the suspense: how far will the guards go? How much can the prisoners take? At what point, if any, will Zimbardo and his team intervene? And is his experiment scientific? Objective? Humane? Worthwhile?"
7/31/2015,60,fresh,Steve Biodrowski,San Andreas,"Propelled by a continuing series of quakes spread out over the entire state, San Andreas is all forward momentum and non-stop action, but with enough narrative focus to avoid letting the calamity totally engulf the picture."

8/21/2015,100,fresh,Pete Hammond,Mad Max: Fury Road,Seek this riveting crime drama out wherever you can find it. Kevin Bacon is creepily great as a corrupt sheriff out to get his police car back from two joy-riding young boys. Director Jon Watts scores with a masterful gem.
8/21/2015,60,fresh,Daniel Barnes,Mad Max: Fury Road,"There's certainly a visual confidence to the first third of the film that hints at greater things ahead for Watts, but the storytelling is pretty flat and predictable."

8/23/2015,80,fresh,Donald Clarke,Testament Of Youth,The Wolfpack ends up being a rare work that deserves the most sentimental of recommendations: it is a hymn to the resilience of the human spirit.
8/23/2015,75,fresh,Robert Levin,Mad Max: Fury Road,A film made with the highest attention to detail and the all-important awareness that so much of what makes a movie work unfolds below the surface of its plot.
8/23/2015,40,rotten,Jason Best,The End Of The Tour,"[A] fascinating true story... gets turned into an uneven mix of historical thriller, courtroom drama and odd-couple comedy."
8/23/2015,40,rotten,Jason Best,Vacation,For the most part writer-directors Jonthan Goldstein and John Francis Daley seem to reckon what we will find hilariously funny is a steady stream of gross-out gags and even grosser paedophilia jokes.
8/23/2015,50,rotten,Robert Levin,Vacation,Lacks the poignancy that set the first film apart. It apes the National Lampoon formula for humor but seems bereft when it comes to showing dad's desperate love for his brood.
8/23/2015,40,rotten,Henry Fitzherbert,Vacation,The writer-directors Jonathan Goldstein and John Francis Daley claim to have updated the story but little feels fresh or contemporary beyond some de rigeur crudeness.

8/23/2015,40,rotten,Jason Best,Fantastic Four,"The film drains the spark from four talented young actors with clunky dialogue and a crushingly dull narrative. The special effects aren't that special, either."
8/23/2015,40,rotten,Alistair Harkness,Paper Towns,"Almost in spite of itself, succeeds in saying something interesting about its teen audience before ultimately revealing itself to be entirely vacuous after all."
8/23/2015,60,fresh,Jason Best,Paper Towns,"The overall mood is safe rather than edgy, but what it does do very effectively is capture a particular quality of adolescent yearning... and Cara Delevingne's puckish charisma is perfect."

8/26/2015,40,rotten,Norman Wilner,Digging For Fire,"Conversations ramble on, ideas are tossed around, and the movie keeps hammering home its metaphor, which is that couples should avoid digging too deeply into scary holes. It's all very whatever, and that isn't enough."

8/26/2015,80,fresh,Rob Carnevale,Trainwreck,"Schumer, meanwhile, is a revelation: her Amy emerging as a volatile force of nature seemingly only ever one step away from self destruct, who nevertheless commands our sympathy and support."
8/26/2015,80,fresh,Rob Carnevale,Mission: Impossible Rogue Nation,Rogue Nation is a blockbuster that expertly combines exhilarating visual thrills with the kind of intricate storyline that requires viewers to pay attention. It also treads a nice line between the drama and the humour.
8/26/2015,100,rotten,Rob Carnevale,Ted 2,"Fortunately, Ted 2 is more hit than miss, trading strongly on the still winning camaraderie between Mark Wahlberg and his foul-mouthed, pot-smoking teddy bear (voiced by MacFarlane) and some genuinely laugh out loud gags."
8/27/2015,40,rotten,Marc Savlov,Sinister 2,"Not half as terrifying as Norwegian black metal, but still one of the better found footage-gimmicked sequels in recent memory."
8/27/2015,40,rotten,James Luxford,Hitman: Agent 47,A shallow cavalcade of action scenes that will probably leave you as cold as 47's expressionless gaze.

8/27/2015,40,rotten,Wendy Ide,Hitman: Agent 47,"It's unlikely this latest instalment was made to fulfil any burning need on the part of the audience, more probably it's a result of the lack of imagination in some sectors of the movie industry."
8/27/2015,20,rotten,Peter Bradshaw,Hitman: Agent 47,"Resembles a uniquely boring, feature-length Audi commercial, incidentally intent on pinching ideas from the first two Terminators."
8/27/2015,100,fresh,Philippa Hawker,Best Of Enemies,"A smart, engrossing documentary about a political and media moment in the United States in the 1960s; a moment whose resonance is topical and whose reverberations have been enduring."
8/27/2015,80,fresh,Sam Watermeier,Best Of Enemies,The film revolves around the famous feud between political pundits Gore Vidal and William F. Buckley Jr. It feeds our urge to be flies on the wall in the midst of such a fight. And it sheds light on why we all share that dark desire.

8/27/2015,80,fresh,Daniel Barnes,Meru,"Segel does great work in an atypical role, and Eisenberg is even more impressive, all needy, nervous laughter and simmering resentment. Their crackling chemistry is essential for a film that finds all of its action in conversation."
8/27/2015,75,fresh,Peter Howell,Meru,"It's a movie that makes thoughtful drama out of the essential insanity of celebrity journalism, wherein a star proclaims humility while a scribbler promises idolatry."
8/27/2015,75,fresh,Calum Marsh,Meru,"[The film] understands that it's a mistake to believe that a road trip with Wallace is enough to somehow solve him... That, I think, is the film's covert virtue: deference. It defers to the complexity of a man it knows it isn't able to comprehend."

8/27/2015,80,fresh,Marjorie Baumgarten,Pitch Perfect 2,"Despite the troubling affair and Minnie's further experimentations with sex and drugs, The Diary of a Teenage Girl is less provocative than it is blunt and honest."
8/27/2015,100,rotten,Michael A. Smith,Black Mass,One of the drawbacks to the film is the length. Director Bird seems so intent on dazzling the audience that he seems to have lost his watch.

8/27/2015,75,fresh,Steven Rea,Digging For Fire,"Conversations drift and weave, as do the people having them. Narcissistic melancholy dukes it out with beer-and-pot-stoked merriment. There is longing. There is foolhardiness."
8/27/2015,75,fresh,John Hartl,Digging For Fire,"While you're watching it, ""Digging for Fire"" may feel slight or tentative, but its cumulative impact is entrancing. Few films about a marital rift make so much of what seems so little."
8/27/2015,100,rotten,Kimberley Jones,Digging For Fire,"Digging for Fire fails its title's own promise: It has the capacity for startling insight and artistry, but mostly it's just a toe listlessly pushing dirt around."
8/27/2015,50,rotten,G. Allen Johnson,Digging For Fire,"Unfortunately, for as much dialogue as ""Digging for Fire"" has, the film doesn't go into much depth about Tim and Lee's true feelings about marriage and their lives."

8/28/2015,40,rotten,Geoffrey Macnab,Hitman: Agent 47,"Some of the set-pieces -- chases through airports, fights on train tracks, car crashes or helicopters hurtling into skyscrapers -- are very niftily choreographed but you can't help thinking this would be more fun as an interactive game."
8/28/2015,80,fresh,Jim Schembri,Best Of Enemies,An often spell-binding account of the culture-changing television debates that took place in 1968 between conservative William F Buckley Jr and liberal Gore Vidal...Compulsive viewing.
8/28/2015,75,fresh,Jeffrey M. Anderson,Z For Zachariah,"This post-apocalyptic drama does away with mutated monsters, evil power mongers, chases, explosions, and grisly effects and simply, effectively focuses on the deeds and emotions of three people."

8/28/2015,25,rotten,John Semley,Meru,"The performances, the writing, the direction, Segel's D.F.W. impression, everything is just fine. But The End of the Tour is disgraceful. It feels like it's towing out the real Wallace's ghost to perform some soppy parody of himself."
8/28/2015,60,fresh,Jim Schembri,Irrational Man,"Woody Allen works through familiar themes of secrecy, murder, morality and personal responsibility, extracting those fluid, naturalistic performances from his cast that have become his signature."

8/28/2015,100,fresh,Jim Schembri,Southpaw,"Though much has been made of the physical transformation Jake Gyllenhaal put himself through to look like a real boxer, Southpaw is a fairly standard, by-the-numbers boxing melodrama that hits all those beats we're accustomed to through the Rocky films."
8/28/2015,100,fresh,Jim Schembri,The Tribe,"What starts out as a standard psycho drama soon develops into a deliciously malicious tale of deceit and secrecy, ridden with some ingenious left turns...will hopefully see Edgerton serve more time behind the camera."

8/31/2015,80,fresh,Alistair Harkness,The Wolfpack,It's an authentic Mad Max movie without being slavishly bound to the past -- a radical notion that's so crazy it just works.
8/31/2015,60,fresh,Henry Fitzherbert,The Wolfpack,"You can almost feel the air whipping around your head and there's an impressive lack of CGI but as an action spectacle the picture has few genuine ""wow"" moments, favouring constant motion over stand-out sequences."

9/1/2015,80,fresh,Amy West,Entourage,"McCarthy is the star of the film, but her willingness to let her fellow actors shine when an opportunity knocks to give the audience a belly-laugh is clear, and it's the undeniable strength of the supporting cast that makes Spy a strong a film."

10/8/2015,75,fresh,Alissa Wilkinson,Brothers,"This is still a very nerdy movie, with lots of botany and physics and ""we ran the numbers and it checks out,"" but most of the book's wonkiness is ironed out in favor of moving the story along more pleasingly for the science-allergic."
10/8/2015,75,fresh,Michael Smith,Brothers,The humor and Damon's normal-guy qualities -- despite being a genius scientist -- make living on Mars all the more relatable to us. He and others also make math look cool. Geeks rule in this movie.

10/8/2015,20,rotten,Matthew Lickona,Under the Sea 3D,"The chief draw here, of course, is Malala herself: an irrepressible, earnest voice for the oppressed."
10/8/2015,100,fresh,Soren Anderson,Under the Sea 3D,Truly a remarkable person.
10/8/2015,60,fresh,Daniel Barnes,Under the Sea 3D,"We get a few glimpses of Malala the hormonal teenager behind Malala the Nobel Peace Prize winner, but this rarely feels like anything more than a press junket in movie form."
10/8/2015,75,fresh,Steven Rea,Under the Sea 3D,"It's quite a story, and if Guggenheim goes overboard in the telling of it, that's perfectly understandable."
10/8/2015,40,rotten,Mabel Salinas,War Room,"An anecdotic film that tries to touch on a lot of subjects and really attempts to be contemplative, but end up being, at best, superficial. [Full review in Spanish]"
10/8/2015,60,fresh,Matt Neal,Infinitely Polar Bear,"Given Depp's performance and the high-calibre cast around him, it's disappointing Black Mass isn't better."
10/8/2015,100,rotten,Jesus Chavarria,The Transporter Refueled,"In spite of the ""unexpected"" plot twists, the movie is predictable and barely holds up for its 90 minute running time. [Full review in Spanish]"
10/8/2015,100,rotten,CJ Johnson,The Walk,"Each scene is played at full volume in a cartoonish style that desperately underlines, bolds, screams and punches every single point and effect Zemeckis is trying to make, as though he's trying to get through to a roomful of deaf babies."
10/8/2015,80,fresh,Elliott Noble,The Walk,It's only when the giddiness passes that you realise you've witnessed not only an incredible true story but a fitting tribute to an unforgettable landmark.
10/8/2015,60,rotten,Jeremy Aspinall,The Walk,Zemeckis has aimed high but on this occasion the documentary reality of Man on Wire trumps the wonder of Hollywood artifice.
10/8/2015,80,fresh,Rob Carnevale,The Walk,It truly deserves to be experienced on the biggest screen possible and it won't fail to impress.
10/8/2015,80,fresh,Cameron Meier,The Walk,"With this loving tribute to not just a great piece of performance art but also the buildings that made that art possible, Zemeckis has given us a magical, if flawed, tribute to the fallen symbols of Americana."
10/8/2015,100,fresh,Jason Zingale,The Walk,"This is the kind of unbelievable true story that you couldn't make up if you tried, and it's ultimately what makes The Walk such an enjoyable, gripping experience."
10/8/2015,20,rotten,Matthew Lickona,Poltergeist,"[Garfield] the protege is the film's first weak point: his avowed decency - he loves his simple mom and moppety son! - is a flimsy thing, and its quick collapse leaves our hero both pathetic and despicable."
10/8/2015,80,fresh,Bill Goodykoontz,Poltergeist,"Bahrani's film asks a timely, yet timeless, question: How far would you go to save your home? Would you be wiling to lose yourself in the bargain?"
10/8/2015,40,rotten,Marc Savlov,Poltergeist,"I wish I could say 99 Homes delivers a shockingly good sucker punch to the American electorate and a stand-up-and-cheer piece of socially conscious filmmaking, but it's not."
10/8/2015,75,fresh,Peter Howell,Poltergeist,"Michael Shannon and Andrew Garfield make for an incendiary combo, as a predatory realtor and his desperate protege."
10/8/2015,60,fresh,Daniel Barnes,Sleeping with Other People,"Headland writes the standard-issue surplus of subplots and scene-hogging supporting characters into the script, but a loose vibe and a cast of adept improvisers push it over."
10/8/2015,80,fresh,Alejandro Frias,Mission: Impossible Rogue Nation,Chistpher McQuarrie has built an exciting and entertaining film full of action: mission accomplished. [Full review in Spanish]
10/9/2015,100,rotten,Rich Cline,Sinister 2,"As the ghoul from the 2012 horror hit stalks a new family, this sequel's sharply well-crafted set-up leaves the hackneyed conclusion feeling very disappointing."
10/9/2015,40,rotten,Rich Cline,The Visit,"While it's great to see M. Night Shyamalan return to the twisty horror genre, his use of found-footage leaves the film feeling like a decent premise with nowhere to go."
10/9/2015,60,fresh,Rich Cline,Straight Outta Compton,"This biopic gallops through the career of groundbreaking gangsta rappers N.W.A, working its way through a checklist of the major events."
10/9/2015,60,fresh,Mike Scott,Mississippi Grind,"A two-handed portrait of addiction, desperation and regret that both narratively and stylistically harks back to the gritty character plays of the 1960s and early 1970s."
10/9/2015,80,fresh,Steve Newton,Goodnight Mommy,It's the most unsettling identical-twin psycho-thriller I've seen since The Other-and that was back in '72!
10/9/2015,100,fresh,Rich Cline,Ricki And The Flash,Meryl Streep is having so much fun playing an ageing rocker that the audience only barely registers that this film isn't nearly as deep as it's pretending to be.
10/9/2015,100,rotten,Jeff Beck,San Andreas,"San Andreas may have impressive special effects, but without a well-developed human element or an emotional core, it becomes a rather empty experience that fails to pull the audience into its tale of epic destruction."
10/9/2015,100,fresh,Rich Cline,99 Homes,"This harrowing morality play is timely and riveting, but never remotely subtle. The setting is the mortgage crisis, during which savvy fast-talkers figured out how to make a fortune on the back of other people's tragedy."
10/9/2015,100,fresh,Rich Cline,The Gift,"Echoing his witty writing style, Bill Bryson's memoir of his trek up the Appalachian Trail is adapted as a gently amusing comedy that combines big landscapes with sharp observational humour."
10/9/2015,100,fresh,Rich Cline,The Tribe,"Marketed as a horror-thriller, this sharply well-made film is actually a bleak drama with a strong message about bullying."
10/9/2015,100,fresh,Jeffrey M. Anderson,Home,"The tone is dreary and deadpan, and by turns funny, sad, lovely, and meditative. But, in completing his trilogy, Andersson ends Pigeon with a new kind of shocking depth."
10/9/2015,80,fresh,Ben Rawson-Jones,A Pigeon Sat on a Branch Reflecting on Existence,"Smart enough to challenge your views, yet not too cerebral to alienate the mainstream, Sicario is a thoroughly engrossing watch that dazzles visually and connects emotionally."
10/9/2015,75,fresh,Tom Meek,Testament Of Youth,"The compelling quality of Moselle's exploration get a great boost from the motion-creating editing and frenetic metal score, not to mention her caring touch."
10/9/2015,80,fresh,Pete Hammond,Brothers,Ridley Scott shows a lighter touch this time in outer space as Matt Damon proves there is life on Mars and in this gem of a sci-fi adventure.
10/9/2015,75,fresh,Jeffrey M. Anderson,Brothers,"The Martian is no masterpiece, but it is a fine film from a talented director."
10/9/2015,80,fresh,Rich Cline,Brothers,"Just as people began to write off veteran director Ridley Scott after a series of merely OK movies, the 77-year-old casually releases his most entertaining film in years."
10/9/2015,75,fresh,Robert Horton,Under the Sea 3D,"The delightful thing is that Malala is too distinctive to simply stand on a pedestal for a do-gooder movie. Her quick, observant personality comes shining out of this project, as though eager to move past her biographer and get on with it."
10/9/2015,60,fresh,Lisa Giles-Keddie,Under the Sea 3D,"Malala is an awesome character in a film that feels mediocre and unsurprising, and much like a party political broadcast at times. A great shame, really."
10/9/2015,80,fresh,Rich Cline,Iris,"One of the strongest action thrillers in recent years, this gripping movie cleverly casts actors known for comedy in the central roles."
10/9/2015,20,rotten,Jeff Beck,No Escape,"The Gallows is a lazy and incompetent production on just about every level, from the writing and directing to the acting and the camerawork."
10/9/2015,60,fresh,Rich Cline,War Room,"Basically the perfect summer movie, this lightweight drama has a great-looking cast and plenty of youthful energy, but not much authenticity or depth."
10/9/2015,60,fresh,Rich Cline,Woman in Gold,"With visually stunning imagery and a solid A-list cast, this film just about transcends its oddly uninvolving story."
10/9/2015,100,fresh,Damien Straker,Infinitely Polar Bear,The two lead actors and the complexity of their involvement to each other carried my interest almost entirely throughout an untidy but compelling and gruesome crime opera.
10/9/2015,100,rotten,Rich Cline,Vacation,"Both the characters and the tone have been updated as a new generation of Grizwolds hits the road for a raucous holiday, eliminating the darker edges for a sillier, ruder romp."
10/9/2015,60,fresh,Rich Cline,The Transporter Refueled,"Like James Bond, wilfully anonymous driver Frank Martin is reborn as a new actor without any fuss, shifting the tone of the franchise from Jason Statham's knowing wink to Ed Skrein's stone-faced glower."
10/9/2015,80,fresh,Neil Pond,The Walk,"Dream-like, hyper-real, beautiful and terrifying, lovely and scary all at once, and you know it's just a movie but you can't believe how giddy and gobsmacked and vertiginous dizzy-awesome it makes you feel."
10/9/2015,80,fresh,Frederic and Mary Ann Brussat,The Walk,"A daring film about the passion, the gratitude, and the beauty of an amazing stunt."
10/9/2015,80,fresh,Jeffrey M. Anderson,The Walk,"Some have complained that the 123-minute movie is a slow starter, but Levitt's feverish, dedicated performance energizes the first half."
10/9/2015,75,fresh,Willie Waffle,The Walk,"When focused on being a caper film, The Walk is entertaining and exciting."
10/9/2015,60,fresh,Simon Miraudo,The Walk,"In Petit's melancholy final monologue, The Walk manages the most skillful high-wire act of all: being moving, without stumbling."
10/9/2015,50,rotten,Jeffrey M. Anderson,The Intern,"For a movie that's supposedly about life experience, The Intern shows very little."
10/9/2015,60,fresh,Rich Cline,The Intern,"This is one of those warm, unchallenging comedies that's entertaining to watch even though something about it feels vaguely inane."
10/9/2015,60,fresh,Amy West,Hotel Transylvania 2,"It might not possess the profound concepts behind the laughs and silly faces of Inside Out, but it's a fun hour-and-a-half that is best spent if you leave your adult mindset at home."
10/9/2015,60,fresh,Rich Cline,Trainwreck,"Amy Schumer makes her big screen debut with a script that feels like a much-extended sketch from her TV series. It's hilariously observant and refreshingly grown-up about sex, but the plot falls back on the usual cliches."
10/9/2015,100,fresh,Rich Cline,Poltergeist,"This harrowing morality play is timely and riveting, but never remotely subtle. The setting is the mortgage crisis, during which savvy fast-talkers figured out how to make a fortune on the back of other people's tragedy."
10/9/2015,60,fresh,Rich Cline,Fantastic Four,"Until the special effects take over in the final act, this is an unusually gritty, grounded superhero thriller, with characters who are so believable that the wacky science almost seems to make sense."
10/9/2015,100,fresh,Rich Cline,Mission: Impossible Rogue Nation,Writer-director Christopher McQuarrie brings a dark and gritty tone to this larger-than-life franchise.
10/9/2015,60,fresh,Rich Cline,Paper Towns,"After setting the scene with vivid characters and some insightful interaction, the plot of this teen comedy-drama feels like a let down."
10/10/2015,75,fresh,David Keyes,The Visit,"Effectively modulated, balancing character exposition with pointed dialogue while injecting the plot's progression with slow (but gradual) increments of terrifying uncertainty."
10/10/2015,75,fresh,Matt Brunson,99 Homes,Say this for 99 Homes: It contains arguably the most truthful snatch of dialogue to be found in any movie released so far in 2015.
10/10/2015,60,fresh,Ben Skipper,Black Mass,The message of Brad Bird's latest is admirable and delivered well -- hoping to inspire young generations and shoot some life into the notion of optimism that cinema should really be all about.
