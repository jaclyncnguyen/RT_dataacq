8/13/2015,75,fresh,Moira MacDonald,People Places Things,"As the movie progresses, Will learns, in his low-key way, that life is full of unexpected twists, that love is hard to put away, and that people who share children can never fully leave each other."

8/11/2015,75,fresh,David Lewis,People Places Things,"Strouse's film is about the changes that occur in all relationships and about letting go when it's time. It will probably not change your worldview about any people, places or things, but it's a pleasant way to spend a couple hours."

12/4/2009,50,rotten,Kyle Smith,Cop Car,"Brothers isn't nearly as unbearable as most of the anti-war pictures of the last five years, but when it comes to members of the armed services, screenwriters continue to lose their ability to think in more than one dimension."

7/8/2015,80,fresh,Preston Jones,Magic Mike XXL,"The ugly unraveling of Winehouse's life infuriates and saddens anew, as Kapadia's poignant documentary reminds viewers of what was and what might have been, but was ultimately, tragically never to be."

10/8/2015,80,fresh,Cary Darling,Poltergeist,"While Bahrani and his co-writers approach the subject matter with all the noisy subtlety of a bar brawl, the film rises above mere polemics thanks to charged performances from Andrew Garfield and especially Michael Shannon."
10/1/2015,75,fresh,Richard Roeper,Poltergeist,"It's still an easy recommendation, with director and co-writer Ramin Bahrani delivering a provocative, visceral, sometimes heartbreakingly relevant drama/thriller."
10/1/2015,100,fresh,J. R. Jones,Poltergeist,99 Homes is both a peerless entertainment and a cri di coeur against a financial system that preyed on the weakest Americans.
10/1/2015,100,fresh,Ty Burr,Poltergeist,"The movie works as a twinned character study, a moral suspense thriller, and an indictment of an America stacked against its working classes."
10/1/2015,75,fresh,Stephanie Merry,Poltergeist,"Director Ramin Bahrani, who wrote the script with Amir Naderi and Bahareh Azimi, spent significant time researching the housing crisis, including witnessing actual evictions, and the episodes he has re-created feel powerfully realistic."
10/1/2015,75,fresh,Michael Phillips,Poltergeist,"At its best, ""99 Homes"" finds Bahrani tightening the screws on his own style, going for speed, concision and an agitating rhythm where his previous films took their time. I hope he'll go on to make movies combining the vital aspects of all his work."
9/25/2015,80,fresh,Cath Clarke,Poltergeist,"The credit crunch fuels another fascinating drama, this time starring Andrew Garfield as a victim who becomes a real-estate predator."
9/25/2015,75,fresh,Peter Travers,Poltergeist,"In these days when Hollywood typically dulls our wits, Ramin Bahrani's 99 Homes has a fire in its belly. It's spoiling to be heard."
8/20/2015,60,fresh,Bill Goodykoontz,Kahlil Gibran's The Prophet,"With top-shelf talent like Bill Plympton, Tomm Moore and Nina Paley on board, it's no surprise that the segments are as attractive as they are different."
8/13/2015,75,fresh,Miriam Di Nunzio,Kahlil Gibran's The Prophet,"The eight independently produced vignettes, culled from Gibran's larger work and strung together by director Roger Allers to create a storyline where there was none, are an entertaining lot."
8/13/2015,75,fresh,David Lewis,Kahlil Gibran's The Prophet,The film is likely to attract new readers to the book - and remind longtime fans why they were attracted to the writings in the first place.
8/6/2015,40,rotten,Joe Neumaier,Kahlil Gibran's The Prophet,"A work of words as lovely as ""The Prophet"" deserves a better artistic interpretation than this animated venture, which consists mostly of pedestrian, '70s-quality visuals."
8/6/2015,50,rotten,Matthew Kassel,Kahlil Gibran's The Prophet,"You get the gist of what he's saying, but at a certain point-near the third quarter of the film, I'd say-the prophet's ambiguous words start to grate."
8/4/2015,40,rotten,James Rocchi,Kahlil Gibran's The Prophet,"""Kahlil Gibran's The Prophet"" is achingly well intentioned, but not especially well executed, and its failings as a film can't be overlooked."

8/7/2015,25,rotten,Jocelyn Noveck,Fantastic Four,"It's not wholesale terrible -- just depressingly mediocre, and at a certain point you sort of start wishing it WERE definitively terrible, because that would at least make it more entertaining or give it a certain strange raison d'etre."
8/7/2015,50,rotten,Kate Taylor,Fantastic Four,A comic book movie that is bizarrely short on humour and action.
8/6/2015,100,rotten,Randy Cordova,Fantastic Four,"The film's lack of scale becomes readily apparent in the final confrontation, which is surprisingly toothless."

8/6/2015,20,rotten,Joe Neumaier,Fantastic Four,"A self-destruct mode is apparently automatically included in any film adaptation of Marvel's ""First Family of Superheroes."" This is the third attempt at a movie franchise - and the third lame result."
8/6/2015,25,rotten,Brian Truitt,Fantastic Four,An unfortunate movie that does an embarrassing disservice to the decades-old property and is a frightful waste of all the talent involved.
8/6/2015,0,rotten,Peter Travers,Fantastic Four,"The latest reboot of the Fantastic Four - the cinematic equivalent of malware - is worse than worthless. It not only scrapes the bottom of the barrel; it knocks out the floor and sucks audiences into a black hole of soul-crushing, coma-inducing dullness."
8/6/2015,40,rotten,Cary Darling,Fantastic Four,A plodding retelling of the Marvel Comics characters' origin story. Everyone involved seems to be just punching the clock until payday.
9/25/2015,75,fresh,Molly Eichel,Sleeping with Other People,"Headland refuses to redeem her characters, which is what makes ""Sleeping With Other People"" ultimately more interesting than other rom-coms."
9/17/2015,60,fresh,Bill Goodykoontz,Sleeping with Other People,"It's pretty regular in terms of plot and story - the kind of thing we've seen many times before, though usually with less likable actors and without all the dirty jokes."
9/17/2015,50,rotten,Stephanie Merry,Sleeping with Other People,"Why Lainey would be enamored by such a dud remains a mystery. So is the reason why Lainey would model lingerie for Jake, considering that the two are trying to keep things platonic."
9/17/2015,75,fresh,Steve Rubenstein,Sleeping with Other People,The movie deftly navigates the tricky geography and timing of romance and heartbreak.
9/17/2015,75,fresh,Lindsey Bahr,Sleeping with Other People,"Sudeikis and Brie have an easy, heady chemistry - although it does take a bit of imagination to accept them (seven years apart in real life) as college contemporaries."
9/10/2015,75,fresh,Peter Travers,Sleeping with Other People,"Even when the laughs are spotty, the actors stay on point. Sudeikis is terrific. And Brie can break you up or just plain break your heart."
9/8/2015,40,rotten,Stephen Whitty,Sleeping with Other People,"If ""Sleeping With Other People"" was someone you met in a bar, you might buy it a drink, or two. But eventually you'd be looking at your phone or searching for a quick exit."
7/31/2015,75,fresh,Barry Hertz,Mission: Impossible Rogue Nation,"Everything, even Alec Baldwin's tight and itchy turn as a CIA buzzkill, is mere window-dressing to Cruise's attempts to kill himself on-screen."
7/30/2015,75,fresh,Ty Burr,Mission: Impossible Rogue Nation,"You can discuss the incongruities on the drive home; while the movie's playing, you're having too much fun getting manhandled by experts."
7/30/2015,75,fresh,Peter Howell,Mission: Impossible Rogue Nation,"At age 53, Tom Cruise is still a credible action hero. But this time, Rebecca Ferguson really gives him a run for his money, and his heart."
7/30/2015,75,fresh,Brian Truitt,Mission: Impossible Rogue Nation,"The action bonanza gets a little lost in its own spycraft, but offers action scenes both fast and furious and a fabulous couple of additions to the world of the IMF (short for Impossible Mission Force, obviously)."
7/30/2015,75,fresh,Ann Hornaday,Mission: Impossible Rogue Nation,"As much as Cruise dominates ""Rogue Nation,"" it's his co-star, Rebecca Ferguson, who emerges as the film's true and most memorable revelation."

4/24/2015,75,fresh,Rene Rodriguez,Ex Machina,"Garland's primary concern is his flesh-and-blood characters, even though they are not nearly as showy (or beautiful) as his main attraction, the vulnerable, delicate girl with a heart of steel and wires."
4/24/2015,75,fresh,Liam Lacey,Ex Machina,A clever film with one indelible performance from Isaac.
4/23/2015,75,fresh,Peter Howell,Ex Machina,"Ex Machina packs a scientist's brain inside a thrill seeker's body, much like the nubile robot within it."
4/23/2015,100,fresh,Steven Rea,Ex Machina,"Like stage actors who live and breathe their roles over the course of months, Isaac, Gleeson, and Vikander excel, and cast a spell."
4/23/2015,100,fresh,Colin Covert,Ex Machina,"""Ex Machina"" is a tense tale of artificial love so intelligently crafted and edgy that I adored it myself."

4/17/2015,100,fresh,Soren Anderson,Ex Machina,"""Ex Machina"" is an exquisite puzzle box of a picture. It baffles. It unsettles. It intrigues."
4/16/2015,75,fresh,Ty Burr,Ex Machina,"""Ex Machina"" isn't quite ""Citizen Kane"" for an era of Internet tycoons, but it suggests that that's not such a bad idea."
4/16/2015,75,fresh,Michael Phillips,Ex Machina,"Garland sidles up to some large ideas, some more provocative than others, and his premise hints at the costs of perpetual, omnivorous surveillance."
4/16/2015,75,fresh,Mick LaSalle,Ex Machina,"It's hard to imagine another director squeezing as many shades and colors from his screenplay as Garland did, and from now on, it would be understandable if he insisted on directing everything he writes."
4/16/2015,100,fresh,Cary Darling,Ex Machina,"Alex Garland brilliantly brings the past into the present with the near-future tale Ex Machina, a stark but dazzling meditation on intelligence, consciousness and morality that discreetly uses special effects in service of story, dialogue and character."
4/15/2015,75,fresh,James Berardinelli,Ex Machina,"In the final analysis, the movie doesn't offer much about the subject that hasn't been previously explored, but the soil is fertile and many ideas germinate."
9/17/2015,75,fresh,Ben Sachs,The Second Mother (Que Horas Ela Volta?),"The characters are so accustomed to keeping up appearances that they can't bring themselves to say what's bugging them. Their interactions may be mild, but the claustrophobic imagery creates the sense of being trapped in a powder keg."
9/10/2015,75,fresh,Molly Eichel,The Second Mother (Que Horas Ela Volta?),"The Second Mother is an interesting look at generational and class divides in Brazil, without the feel of a lecture or lesson."
9/10/2015,80,fresh,Bill Goodykoontz,The Second Mother (Que Horas Ela Volta?),"We've seen plenty of stories about the arrival of a mysterious stranger upsetting the order of things. But ""The Second Mother,"" Brazilian writer and director Anna Muylaert's outstanding film, is different."
9/2/2015,75,fresh,Steve Rubenstein,The Second Mother (Que Horas Ela Volta?),"It's the funny, edgy, engaging tale of a fingers-to-the-bone maid who must cope with a small-minded employer, a headstrong daughter and a changing social fabric harder to handle than the endless laundry she hangs on the clothesline."
9/1/2015,80,fresh,Dave Calhoun,The Second Mother (Que Horas Ela Volta?),"Anna Muylaert's observations on family relations and invisible-but-firm class barriers are always acute, even if she ultimately mines them for hope rather than horror."
8/28/2015,75,fresh,Julian Carrington,The Second Mother (Que Horas Ela Volta?),Muylaert's film is an effervescent comic drama that delights in the disruption of traditional upstairs/downstairs dynamics.
8/26/2015,75,fresh,Farran Smith Nehme,The Second Mother (Que Horas Ela Volta?),"Case gives one of the warmest, most lovable performances of the year; the film's real climax comes when she simply wades into a nearly empty swimming pool."

6/26/2015,50,rotten,James Berardinelli,Ted 2,"The film fumbles its lame narrative and, although some of MacFarlane's jokes are hilarious, they're just blips on the radar."
6/25/2015,50,rotten,Mark Feeney,Ted 2,"When Ted sits on his couch watching a clip from ""Roots"" and compares his situation to that of Kunta Kinte getting whipped, you may want to sink into your seat."
6/25/2015,50,rotten,Brian Truitt,Ted 2,"MacFarlane and co-writers Alec Sulkin and Wellesley Wild have a gift for referential riffs, but the plot is the thinnest of narratives just to connect all the comedy bits."
6/25/2015,50,rotten,Peter Howell,Ted 2,"If you didn't see and laugh at the first Ted, and maybe also at MacFarlane's button-pushing TV series Family Guy, then another movie deserves your entertainment dollars."

6/25/2015,50,rotten,David Lewis,A Little Chaos,"We get ready for the sparks to fly, but the scenes between Winslet and Schoenaerts fall flat. In fact, we pay more attention to the beautiful costumes and art direction than to any exchange between the two romantic leads."
